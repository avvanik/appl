# EDI File Specification

assumptions on further developement: 

Until now, the program connects to a sqlite database and creates one table where chosen data from text file is getting inserted into. 
As only one table has been created, the table itself looks messy. The file has to be passed in the project itself. 

In the next steps an interface should be created to pass the path to the file. 
For each new file a new table insight the db should be created. 

The readme file should then explain the steps how to read file from CLI.
